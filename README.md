Bacterial ancestors were the first living cells to appear on Earth. 
For most of human history, people knew little about the true 
causes, transmission, and effective treatment of disease. Let’s 
look now at some key developments in microbiology that have 
spurred the field to its current technological state.
The First Observations
In 1665, after observing a thin slice of cork through a crude 
microscope, Englishman Robert Hooke reported that life’s 
smallest structural units were “little boxes,” or “cells.” Using 
his improved microscope, Hooke later saw individual cells. 
Hooke’s discovery marked the beginning of the cell theory—
the theory that all living things are composed of cells.
Though Hooke’s microscope was capable of showing large 
cells, it lacked the resolution that would have allowed him to see 
microbes clearly. Dutch merchant and amateur scientist Anton 
van Leeuwenhoek was probably the first to observe live micro-
organisms through the magnifying lenses of the more than
400 microscopes he constructed. Between 1673 and 1723, he 
wrote about the “animalcules” he saw through his simple, single-
lens microscopes. Van Leeuwenhoek made detailed drawings of 
organisms he found in rainwater, feces, and material scraped from 
teeth. These drawings have since been identified as representa-
tions of bacteria and protozoa (Figure 1.3).

The Debate over Spontaneous Generation
After van Leeuwenhoek discovered the previously “invisible” 
world of microorganisms, the scientific community became 
interested in the origins of these tiny living things. Until the 
second half of the nineteenth century, many scientists and 
philosophers believed that some forms of life could arise 
spontaneously from nonliving matter; they called this hypo-
thetical process spontaneous generation. Not much more than 
100 years ago, people commonly believed that toads, snakes, 
and mice could be born of moist soil; that flies could emerge 
from manure; and that maggots (which we now know are the 
larvae of flies) could arise from decaying corpses.
Physician Francesco Redi set out in 1668 to demonstrate 
that maggots did not arise spontaneously. Redi filled two 
jars with decaying meat. The first was left unsealed, allowing flies to lay eggs on the meat, which developed into larvae. 
The second jar was sealed, and because the flies could not get 
inside, no maggots appeared. Still, Redi’s antagonists were 
not convinced; they claimed that fresh air was needed for 
spontaneous generation. So Redi set up a second experiment, 
in which he covered a jar with a fine net instead of sealing it. 
No larvae appeared in the gauze-covered jar, even though air 
was present.
Redi’s results were a serious blow to the long-held belief 
that large forms of life could arise from nonlife. However, 
many scientists still believed that small organisms, such as van 
Leeuwenhoek’s “animalcules,” were simple enough to generate 
from nonliving materials.
The case for spontaneous generation of microorganisms 
seemed to be strengthened in 1745, when John Needham found 
that even after he heated chicken broth and corn broth before 
pouring them into covered flasks, the cooled solutions were 
soon teeming with microorganisms. Needham claimed that 
microbes developed spontaneously from the fluids. Twenty 
years later, Lazzaro Spallanzani suggested that microorganisms 
from the air probably entered Needham’s solutions after they 
were boiled. Spallanzani showed that nutrient fluids heated 
after being sealed in a flask did not develop microbial growth. 
Needham responded by claiming the “vital force” necessary for 
spontaneous generation had been destroyed by the heat and 
was kept out of the flasks by the seals.
