Bacterial ancestors were the first living cells to appear on Earth. 
For most of human history, people knew little about the true 
causes, transmission, and effective treatment of disease. Let’s 
look now at some key developments in microbiology that have 
spurred the field to its current technological state.
The First Observations
In 1665, after observing a thin slice of cork through a crude 
microscope, Englishman Robert Hooke reported that life’s 
smallest structural units were “little boxes,” or “cells.” Using 
his improved microscope, Hooke later saw individual cells. 
Hooke’s discovery marked the beginning of the cell theory—
the theory that all living things are composed of cells.
Though Hooke’s microscope was capable of showing large 
cells, it lacked the resolution that would have allowed him to see 
microbes clearly. Dutch merchant and amateur scientist Anton 
van Leeuwenhoek was probably the first to observe live micro-
organisms through the magnifying lenses of the more than
400 microscopes he constructed. Between 1673 and 1723, he 
wrote about the “animalcules” he saw through his simple, single-
lens microscopes. Van Leeuwenhoek made detailed drawings of 
organisms he found in rainwater, feces, and material scraped from 
teeth. These drawings have since been identified as representa-
tions of bacteria and protozoa (Figure 1.3).

The Debate over Spontaneous Generation
After van Leeuwenhoek discovered the previously “invisible” 
world of microorganisms, the scientific community became 
interested in the origins of these tiny living things. Until the 
second half of the nineteenth century, many scientists and 
philosophers believed that some forms of life could arise 
spontaneously from nonliving matter; they called this hypo-
thetical process spontaneous generation. Not much more than 
100 years ago, people commonly believed that toads, snakes, 
and mice could be born of moist soil; that flies could emerge 
from manure; and that maggots (which we now know are the 
larvae of flies) could arise from decaying corpses.
Physician Francesco Redi set out in 1668 to demonstrate 
that maggots did not arise spontaneously. Redi filled two 
jars with decaying meat. The first was left unsealed, allowing
