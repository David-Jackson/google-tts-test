van Leeuwenhoek.
1-7 Compare spontaneous generation and biogenesis.
1-8 Identify the contributions to microbiology made by Needham, 
Spallanzani, Virchow, and Pasteur.
1-9 Explain how Pasteur’s work influenced Lister and Koch.
1-10 Identify the importance of Koch’s postulates.
1-11 Identify the importance of Jenner’s work.
1-12 Identify the contributions to microbiology made by Ehrlich 
and Fleming.
1-13 Define bacteriology, mycology, parasitology, immunology, and 
virology.
1-14 Explain the importance of microbial genetics, molecular 
biology, and genomics.
Bacterial ancestors were the first living cells to appear on Earth. 
For most of human history, people knew little about the true 
causes, transmission, and effective treatment of disease. Let’s 
look now at some key developments in microbiology that have 
spurred the field to its current technological state.
The First Observations
In 1665, after observing a thin slice of cork through a crude 
microscope, Englishman Robert Hooke reported that life’s 
smallest structural units were “little boxes,” or “cells.” Using 
his improved microscope, Hooke later saw individual cells. 
Hooke’s discovery marked the beginning of the cell theory—
the theory that all living things are composed of cells.
Though Hooke’s microscope was capable of showing large 
cells, it lacked the resolution that would have allowed him to see 
microbes clearly. Dutch merchant and amateur scientist Anton 
van Leeuwenhoek was probably the first to observe live micro-
organisms through the magnifying lenses of the more than
